DivusMod
========

Divus is my mod in progress for minecraft 1.7, completely open source and open to see. The main premise of this mod is moral choices affecting who you are in minecraft. For example, killing certain mobs or performing specific actions will give you a certain morality trait (this system has yet to be implemented) all help and suggestions with the code is appreciated, and for those less experienced modders, I hope that seeing how I make my mod will help you in some way.
